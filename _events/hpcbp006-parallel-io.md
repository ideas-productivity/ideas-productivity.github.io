Parallel data management is a complex problem at large-scale HPC
environments. The HPC I/O stack can be viewed as a multi-layered cake
and presents an high-level abstraction to the scientists. While this
abstraction shields the users from many of the I/O system details, it
is very hard to obtain parallel I/O performance or functionality
without understanding the end-to-end hierarchical I/O stack in todayâ€™s
modern complex HPC environments. This talk will introduce the basic
parallel I/O concepts and will provide guidelines on obtaining better
I/O performance on large-scale parallel platforms.
