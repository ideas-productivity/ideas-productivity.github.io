    bio: "Michael Heroux is a senior scientist at the
Center for Computing Research, Sandia National Laboratories, in
Albuquerque, New Mexico. In his career, Michael has worked on various
aspects of High Performance Computing, going back to Cray Research in
the early 90â€™s. At Sandia, he works on new parallel algorithm
developments for problems of interest to Sandia and the broader
scientific and engineering community. Michael leads the development of
Trilinos, which provides state of the art solution methods in a state
of the art software framework, the Mantevo project, which focuses on
the development of Open Source, portable mini-applications and
mini-drivers for scientific and engineering applications, and the
(Interoperable Design of Extreme-scale Application Software-ECP)
IDEAS-ECP project, which is dedicated to engaging with scientific
software teams to identify and promote practices that improve software
productivity and sustainability."

Software development is an essential activity for many scientific
teams.  Modeling, simulation and data analysis, using team-developed
software, are increasing valuable for scientific discovery and
engineering. Many teams use informal, ad hoc approaches for managing
their software efforts.  While sufficient for many efforts, a modest
emphasis on team models and processes can substantially improve
developer productivity and software sustainability. In this
presentation, we discuss several light-weight techniques for managing
scientific software efforts.  Using checklists, policy statements and
a Kanban workflow system, we emphasize techniques for managing the
initiation and exit of team members, approaches to synthesizing team
culture, and ways to improve communication within a team and with its
stakeholders.
