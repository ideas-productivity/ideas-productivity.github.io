This BoF brings together participants to build a community and share information and ideas around exploring the challenges in sustainability of HPC software, focusing on 1) defining and measuring research software sustainability metrics and 2) enhancing research software stewardship practices. Participants will discuss software project community health, engineering practices, and funding stability. The session aims to foster collaboration, share insights, and develop actionable strategies for the long-term viability of HPC software projects.
