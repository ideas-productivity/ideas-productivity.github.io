Spack is a package manager for scientific computing, with a rapidly growing open source community. With over 500 contributors from academia, industry, and government laboratories, Spack has a wide range of use cases, from small-scale development on laptops and clusters, to software release management for the U.S. Exascale Computing Project, to user software deployment on 6 of the top 10 supercomputer sites in the world.

Spack isn’t just for facilities, though! As a package manager, Spack is in a powerful position to impact DevOps and daily software development workflows. Spack has virtual environments that enable the “manifest and lock” model popularized by more mainstream dependency management tools. New releases of Spack include direct support for creating containers and gitlab CI pipelines for building environments. This webinar will cover new features as well as the near- and long-term roadmap for Spack.
