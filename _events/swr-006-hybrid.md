In Spring 2020 many workers abruptly transitioned from a primarily on-site to a primarily remote work experience.  Many people will be (or already are) transitioning to a hybrid experience, spending some days on site and some remote.  Working in this hybrid setting is likely to last longer for many people than the primarily remote setting.  For some, the hybrid setting may go on indefinitely. In this panel discussion, we learn from colleagues who have worked in a hybrid setting during their careers, as well as some who are new to remote work.  We will discuss some of the challenges we have faced in primarily remote settings and how these challenges might be addressed in hybrid settings. Themes will include making effective use of time on site, best practices and principles for teams who are blended remote and on site, and how to be effective and efficient in long-term hybrid settings.
