In scientific software development design priorities such as cost, speed, convenience, open architecture, backward compatibility, and others often trump security requirements. Moreover, this problem is compounded by an increased dependence on the integration of a myriad of software packages and technologies along with an increased need for long-term sustainable software. Thus, incorporating secure software knowledge and practices into scientific software development is becoming increasingly critical to mitigate and defend against malicious attacks that can cause extreme damage to any piece of software, compromising integrity, authentication, and availability. The webinar aims to address this issue by providing a comprehensive overview of the secure software development process and a thorough introduction to threat modeling and security assurance testing.
