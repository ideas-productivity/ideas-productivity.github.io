Bill Hoffman, the creator of the CMake project, will give an
introduction to development with modern CMake constructs. CMake is 17
years old and has evolved over time into the most widely used C++
build tool in the world. In the past 5 years, many new features have
been added to CMake to make the creation of cross-platform build files
easier. This webinar will provide best practices for development and
maintenance of a CMake build system. The webinar will cover the
“target centric” approach to writing CMake files. In addition, testing
and quality dashboards with CDash will be covered. Kitware’s
experience with HPC systems and CMake will also be discussed.
