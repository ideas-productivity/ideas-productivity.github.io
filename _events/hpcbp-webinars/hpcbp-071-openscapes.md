Openscapes champions open practices in environmental science to help uncover data-driven solutions faster. In this webinar the speaker will share how she transitioned from doing her own marine ecology research to founding Openscapes to support other researchers and grow the global Open Science movement. The speaker will share lessons learned from her work mentoring government, non-profit, and academic environmental and Earth teams, with specific stories from projects with NASA and NOAA Fisheries. The webinar will reuse parts of a recent keynote at RStudio::conf that was the global launch of Quarto, a new, open-source, scientific and technical publishing system. The webinar will include a demo on some features of Quarto for R and Python users and highlight how more reusing and less reinventing is critical for science. The speaker will also discuss how open source/science is a daily practice, and an important avenue to increase inclusion in science and contribute to the climate movement.
