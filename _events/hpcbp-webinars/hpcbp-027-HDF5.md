HDF5 is a data model, file format, and I/O library that has become a
de facto standard for HPC applications to achieve scalable I/O and for
storing and managing big data from computer modeling, large physics
experiments and observations. This webinar will give an introduction
to using the HDF5 library, with a focus on parallel I/O and
performance tuning options. The webinar will also provide an overview
of the latest performance and productivity enhancement features being
developed as part of the DOEâ€™s Exascale Computing Project (ECP)
ExaHDF5 effort, and will present optimizations used in improving I/O
performance of ECP applications.
