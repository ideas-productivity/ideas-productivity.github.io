    bio: "Andrew Lumsdaine is currently Chief
Scientist at the Northwest Institute for Advanced Computing, a
Seattle-based joint research institute between Pacific Northwest
National Laboratory and the University of Washington.  His current
research interests focus on scalable graph analytics and the
convergence of Big Data, HPC, and machine learning.  He and members of
his research group made several notable contributions to C++11,
including variadic templates, decltype, lambdas, and enable_if. Andrew
is one of the recipients of the 2019 BSSw Fellowships. The BSSw
Fellowships Program gives recognition and funding to leaders and
advocates of high-quality scientific software."

Since its creation by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s, C++ has
steadily evolved to become a multi-paradigm programming language that
fully supports the needs of modern programmers. Because C++ had its
roots in the C programming language, conventional wisdom (and
longstanding practice) had been to use C++ in a dichotomous fashion:
abstractions for productivity with escape to C for
performance. However, C++ today is best viewed holistically — as it is
today — rather than as extension of C or even of earlier versions of
C++. In this webinar I will give a tour of features from modern C++
relevant to HPC, along with guidelines for their use — and demonstrate
that C++ can offer productivity and elegance while sacrificing nothing
in performance.
