Commemorating the 50th Anniversary of the Apollo Moon landings, this
webinar will describe the revolutionary computer, the Apollo Guidance
Computer (AGC). The AGC made autonomous travel to the Moon and back
not only possible but added profoundly to crew safety, flight profile
accuracy and even optimized propellant use to such an extent that
final missions plans traded fuel for added weight in equipment and
lunar samples. The webinar will give an overview of the AGC hardware
architecture, the guidance software it executed as well as the
pioneering efforts in developing both. HPC/CSE code teams will
discover many familiar themes such as flops/watt power constraints and
performance portability challenges. The webinar will conclude with
several user stories about the actual operation of the AGC in various
Apollo missions.
