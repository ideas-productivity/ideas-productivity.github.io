  - name: Rollin Thomas
    affiliation: National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center
    github-id: rcthomas
    bio: "Rollin Thomas is a Big Data Architect in the Data
and Analytics Services group. Prior to joining NERSC in 2015, he was a
Staff Scientist in the Computational Research Division.  He has worked
on numerical simulations of supernova atmospheres, observation and
analysis of supernova spectroscopy data, and data management for
supernova cosmology experiments.  Rollin has served as a member of the
Nearby Supernova Factory, is a builder on the Dark Energy Survey, and
is a full member of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope Dark Energy
Science Collaboration.  He holds a B.S. in physics from Purdue
University and a Ph.D. in astrophysics from the University of
Oklahoma."
  - name: William Scullin

    bio: "William Scullin is an Assistant Computational
Scientist Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. He is a HPC systems
expert and computational generalist with a strong background in
systems administration who enables science through skillful
utilization of some of the largest supercomputers on Earth. He was an
active developer and evangelist of Python software and tools to
improve system and scientific productivity in HPC environments."
  - name: Matt Belhorn
    affiliation: Oak Ridge National Laboratory
    github-id: mpbelhorn
    bio: "Matt Belhorn is an HPC support specialist,
providing technical support and training to researchers employing the
OLCF’s leadership-class public research compute resources. Matt has a
research background in experimental high-energy particle physics. He
was a long-time collaborator of the Belle and BelleII CP-violation
experiments located at the Japanese High-Energy Accelerator Research
Organization (KEK). His research efforts include contributions to the
design and construction of BelleII’s Imaging Time-of-Propagation
(iTOP) counter. Matt developed his interest in high-performance
computing while analyzing the physics of spontaneous
particle-antiparticle oscillations."

Python’s powerful elegance has driven its adoption at HPC centers for
job orchestration, visualization, exploratory data analysis, and even
simulation.  But maximizing performance from Python applications can
be challenging especially on supercomputing architectures.  This
webinar will explain those challenges with a practical emphasis on
using Python at NERSC, ALCF, and OLCF.  We will outline a variety of
performance optimization strategies, tools for measuring and
addressing performance problems, and establish best practices for
Python in HPC.
