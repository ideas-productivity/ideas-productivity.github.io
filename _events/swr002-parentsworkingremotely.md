panelists:
  - name: Katherine Evans
    affiliation: Oak Ridge National Laboratory
    github-id: kevans32
    bio: "Katherine Evans is the division director for the computational
sciences and engineering division at ORNL. Performing this job when
working remotely during a pandemic in a house with a high school
senior, college senior, and fellow scientist/manager/husband Tom (see
bio below) requires staking out the quietest room in the house to
perform a range of calls. On these calls, she attempts to assure her
staff that its ok to let the kids cry in the background and asks for
clarity from her management to guide her through the unforeseen
logistical issues for 100 people to work remotely and 20 staff to risk
their health to continue their work onsite.  During this exercise, Tom
and the kids also have many online meetings/classes/gaming and she
thanks herself daily that her husband Tom successfully argued to
upgrade the family internet to 100Gb fiber just last year. The beagle
enjoys the new family schedule and has learned that the kids give in
to the cute dog face so she now eats about 10 times a day."

with parents and children alike to form schedules, activities, and
structure that works best for them."
  - name: Lindsey Hughes
    affiliation: Sandia National Laboratories
    bio: "Lindsey Hughes just transitioned to a systems engineer role supporting
the W80-4. She and her husband have worked at Sandia National

While working remotely is challenging enough, many are currently
experiencing unique complexities involved with parenting,
transitioning to online school at home, and working productively while
practicing social distancing in response to COVID-19.  In the second
installment of the IDEAS-ECP panel discussion series, we brought
together four ECP staff members, a new staff member on-boarding with a
National Lab, and a Montessori educator to share ideas and resources.
