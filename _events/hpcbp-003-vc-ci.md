Recently, many tools and workflows have emerged in the software
industry that have greatly enhanced the productivity of development
teams. GitHub, a site that hosts projects in Git repositories, is a
popular platform for open source and closed source projects.  GitHub
has encoded several best practices into easily followed procedures
such as pull requests, which enrich the software engineering
vocabularies of non-professionals and professionals alike.  GitHub
also provides integration to other services (for example, continuous
integration such as Travis CI, which allows code changes to be
automatically tested before they are merged into a master development
branch).  This presentation will discuss how to set up a project on
GitHub, illustrate the use of pull requests to incorporate code
changes, and show how Travis CI can be used to boost confidence that
changes will not break existing code.
