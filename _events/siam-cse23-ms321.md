Modern scientific research is a software-intensive activity. All the more so in particular areas such as computational science and engineering (CSE), especially in the context of high-performance computing (HPC). This minisymposium brings together software engineering researchers and developers of CSE software to explore what research tells us about how we develop and use scientific software, and how we can do a better job of it. The minisymposium will focus on the experiences and lessons learned regarding appropriate application of software engineering practices to CSE software.
