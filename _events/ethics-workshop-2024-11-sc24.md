Advances in HPC raise enduring and difficult social, economic, epistemological, and ethical issues. This fact is dramatically illustrated by the successes and pitfalls of artificial intelligence. But there exist many other social issues engendered by HPC. These outstanding issues are genuinely interdisciplinary: they cannot be adequately addressed without input from experts inside and outside a traditional STEM sphere of influence. The goal of this symposium is to bring together researchers from diverse fields to share experiences addressing these difficult issues in HPC, gain a mutual interdisciplinary understanding of their complexities, and discuss issues of mutual interest at the international heart of HPC activity. This symposium will be a mix of invited speakers and spirited discussion among attendees.
