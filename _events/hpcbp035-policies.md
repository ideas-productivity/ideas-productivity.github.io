The development of increasingly complex computer architectures and
software ecosystems continues. Applications that incorporate
multiphysics modeling as well as the coupling of simulation and data
analytics increasingly require the combined use of software packages
developed by diverse, independent teams throughout the HPC
community. The Extreme-scale Scientiﬁc Software Development Kit (xSDK)
is being developed to provide coordinated infrastructure for
independent mathematical libraries to support the productive and
efficient development of high-quality applications. This webinar will
discuss the development and impact of xSDK community policies, which
constitute an integral part of the project and have been defined to
achieve improved code quality and compatibility across xSDK member
packages and a sustainable software ecosystem.
