Software is increasingly important in research, and some of the
scholarly communications community, for example, in FORCE11, has been
pushing the concept of software citations as a method to allow
software developers and maintainers to get academic credit for their
work: software releases are published and assigned DOIs, and software
users then cite these releases when they publish research that uses
the software. This webinar will discuss the state of software
citation, starting with history of work done by the FORCE11 Software
Citation Working Group, leading to a published set of software
citation principles (<https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.86>), as well
as other prior work. It will also talk about where the community is
going, what the obstacles to progress are, and how they may be
overcome.
