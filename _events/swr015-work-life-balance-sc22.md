## Panelists

- Scott Callaghan (University of Southern California)
- Fernanda Foertter (Voltron Data)
- Julia Mullen (MIT Lincoln Laboratory)

## Moderator

- Elaine Raybourn (Sandia National Laboratories)

## Description

This panel features brief presentations followed by engaging discussion from contributors to the SC22 Early Career Program invited talks on life/work balance conducted at the annual International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis (SC22). Speakers will provide tips and lessons shared with the SC22 Early Career Program panel on work/life balance, parenting, strategies for working remotely, and on how everyone, especially those early in their careers, can apply lessons learned from pandemic-driven change and resiliency.

## Panelist Bios

Scott Callaghan is a research programmer at the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC), based in Los Angeles, though he works remotely from St. Louis, Missouri. He first got involved at SCEC as an undergraduate intern, then as a graduate student, and now as staff. Scott is the project lead on a software application which performs physics-based probabilistic seismic hazard analysis for California. This software typically runs on large HPC systems such as Blue Waters at NCSA and Titan at OLCF. His research interests include scientific workflows and high throughput computing.

Fernanda Foertter is a Director at Voltron Data. She was previously a GPU Developer Advocate for Healthcare HPC+AI with NVIDIA, and before that in the HPC User Assistance Group as an HPC Programmer and Training Coordinator at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility. She participated in the CORAL project that selected Summit as the next supercomputer to replace Titan.

Julia Mullen is a member of the technical staff in the MIT Lincoln Laboratory Supercomputing Center (LLSC), where she assists researchers in maximizing their use of high-performance computing resources in order to minimize their time to solution. As an expert in high-performance computing for computational engineering applications, she focuses on redesigning scientific workflows to streamline processing and improve the performance of computational engineering applications.

## Moderator Bio

Elaine M. Raybourn is a social scientist in the Statistics and Human Systems Group (Applied Cognitive Science) at Sandia National Laboratories. Her research focuses on virtual teams, methods for software productivity, immersive virtual environments, scientific visualization, and transmedia learning. She was the SC21 Scientific Visualization & Data Analytics Showcase Chair. Elaine has worked remotely for a combined total of 15 years while at Sandia National Laboratories: from the UK as a guest researcher at British Telecom; Germany (Fraunhofer FIT) and France (INRIA) as a Fellow of the European Research Consortium in Informatics and Mathematics (ERCIM), and most recently as Sandiaâ€™s Institutional PI for the Exascale Computing Project (ECP) Interoperable Design of Extreme-scale Application Software (IDEAS) productivity project. Elaine leads PSIP and the ECP panel series Strategies for Working Remotely.
