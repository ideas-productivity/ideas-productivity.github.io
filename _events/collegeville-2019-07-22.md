The goal of this workshop is to bring together community leaders and practitioners in scientific software for the purpose of identifying the challenges and priority research direction for improving the sustainability of scientific software. We want to explore, characterize and articulate scientific software practices from industry, research labs and academia and identify common requirements and essential differences in these communities.

We will write a workshop report to describe our findings and articulate research priorities that will advance the sustainability of scientific software, especially toward better usability across industry, lab and academic institutions. We anticipate that the diverse experience of the workshop attendees will lead to a deeper awareness and understanding of how the represented communities can benefit from collaboration, coordination and complementarity.
