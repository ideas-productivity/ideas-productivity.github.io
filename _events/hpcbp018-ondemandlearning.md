Continual advances in new technologies for computational science often
require members of the HPC community to learn new tools, techniques,
or processes on-demand, or outside of a formal education
setting. While the variety of media and deluge of content make
on-demand learning a reality, very few learners apply guiding
principles from learning science to set themselves up for
success. Applying on-demand learning strategies for self-paced
“learning in the wild” can augment professional learning courses from
EdX, Udacity, and YouTube. Employing use cases and examples from
Python and Git, this webinar will demonstrate how to develop a
personalized learning framework leveraging massively open online
courses (MOOC), podcasts, social media, videos, and more. A walk
through of relevant learning applications will be
provided. Participants of this webinar will take away practical
strategies, resources, and tools that can be applied toward learning
more productively in general, and specifically to software
development.
