Many of us have been working remotely well over 13 months now due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We’ve hosted 7 panel discussions since April 2020 that allowed us to share resiliency strategies for working remotely as most of us transitioned from co-located to fully virtual work. That said, 13 months and 7 panel discussions later, how much do we know about how working remotely and a phased return to “the office” will impact our creativity? Do we do our best work when isolated? What is it about serendipitous face-to-face interactions that we find difficult to replicate online? In our eighth installment of the panel discussion series, we explore the topics of creativity and innovation with software development teams who are applying agile techniques, thinking differently about co-located collaboration, and questioning the unintended effects of working remotely. Panelists will make brief introductory comments followed by open discussion. Questions can be submitted by the audience in advance to remote@acm.org.
