This webinar will continue the discussion of open source software
(OSS) opportunities within the scientific ecosystem to include the
many cloud and local services available to OSS free of charge. The
services to be discussed include continuous integration, code
coverage, and static analysis. The presenters will demonstrate the
usefulness of these tools and how a small time investment at the
beginning is traded for long-term benefits. These services and ideas
are agnostic to software language or HPC software application and
should apply to any party interested in tools that help ease the
burden of software maintenance.
