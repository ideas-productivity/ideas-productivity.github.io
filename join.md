# We need you!

A long-term goal of IDEAS is to help change the culture of scientific computing to place more emphasis on productive and sustainable software development as a critical and rewarded aspect of overall scientific advancement, rather than focusing only on science results. If you’re of a like mind and want to get involved, there are plenty of opportunities. The more people who are engaged, the bigger the difference we can make for scientific software development!

## How to stay informed:

- **[Join our mailing list](https://us16.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=5438ff2caf2456f6ec49ebfbf&id=a7f7d33358)** for announcements of upcoming webinars and other events
- Browse our archive of **[past events](https://ideas-productivity.org/events/)** (many of which have content online), including the complete archives of the [HPC Best Practices](https://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars/) webinars


## How to get involved:

- Contribute your ideas and favorite resources to **Better Scientific Software ([BSSw.io](https://bssw.io))**---a community-driven website with both original content and pointers to external resources focused on software development, productivity, and sustainability.  Contributions are welcome, and are as easy as a GitHub pull request!

- Attend and collaborate to organize events, including the **[Best Practices for HPC Software Developers](https://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars/)** webinar series, and **[tutorials, minisymposia, poster sessions, and birds-of-a-feather sessions](https://ideas-productivity.org/events/)** at a wide range of conferences and other events, with many different ways to get involved. Email us to suggest a topic for the HPC Best Practices webinars or volunteer to give a webinar or partner with us in a tutorial.

- Consider partnering with a software community---either joining an existing Software Development Kit (SDK) or starting another SDK in an area of interest to you. 
    - The **[Extreme-scale Scientific Software Development Kit (xSDK)](https://xsdk.info)** is a spin-off of the IDEAS project. Members of the xSDK community are working toward a community software ecosystem, including packages developed by diverse, independent teams.  If you develop a numerical software package, consider contributing.  Or have a look at the **[community policies](https://xsdk.info/policies/)** and consider starting another SDK in an area of interest to you.
    - Check out SDK-Tools.
    - Learn about E4S. 


## How to participate throughout the community:

- Get involved with **Research Software Engineers (RSEs)**, including [US-RSE](https://us-rse.org) and international counterparts such as the UK [Society of Research Software Engineering](https://society-rse.org).   The term “Research Software Engineering” is gaining greater recognition as describing a job or career path for many interesting in scientific software, and there is a growing community of RSE organizations around the world.  These groups are raising awareness of software’s vital role in research and advancing advocacy and resources for those who regularly use expertise in programming to advance research. 

- The UK **[Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk)**---an international leader in advancing software practices---provides many great resources.

- Learn from and teach for **[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org)** -- organizers of **[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org)**, **[Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org)), **[Library Carpentry]**(https://librarycarpentry.org)**, and the inspiration for **[HPC Carpentry](http://www.hpc-carpentry.org)**. The Carpentries teach foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide.
 
- The Q&A service Stack Exchange has several sites of interest:
    - **[Computational Science](https://scicomp.stackexchange.com)** tends to be more towards methods than software per se, but many interested in IDEAS use the site and contribute.

- BSSw.io also includes pointers to many other places to get involved in the community!

### Events

- The Collegeville workshop series
- The Software Engineering for Computational Science (SE4Science) workshop series usually hold two workshops each year, alternating between software engineering and scientific computing/HPC conferences.
- See more details on a variety of events
