# We need you!

A long-term goal of IDEAS is to help change the culture of scientific computing to place more emphasis on productive and sustainable software development as a critical and rewarded aspect of overall scientific advancement, rather than focusing only on science results. If you’re of a like mind and want to get involved, there are plenty of opportunities. The more people who are engaged, the bigger the difference we can make for scientific software development!

## How to stay informed:

- **[Join our mailing list](https://us16.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=5438ff2caf2456f6ec49ebfbf&id=a7f7d33358)** for announcements of upcoming webinars and other events
- Browse our archive of **[past events](https://ideas-productivity.org/events/)** (many of which have content online), including the complete archives of the [HPC Best Practices](https://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars/) webinars


## How to get involved:

- Contribute your ideas and favorite resources to **Better Scientific Software ([BSSw.io](https://bssw.io))**---a community-driven website with both original content and pointers to external resources focused on software development, productivity, and sustainability.  Contributions are welcome, and are as easy as a GitHub pull request!

- Attend and collaborate to organize events, including the **[Best Practices for HPC Software Developers](https://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars/)** webinar series, and **[tutorials, minisymposia, poster sessions, and birds-of-a-feather sessions](https://ideas-productivity.org/events/)** at a wide range of conferences and other events, with many different ways to get involved. Email us to suggest a topic for the HPC Best Practices webinars or volunteer to give a webinar or partner with us in a tutorial.

- Consider partnering with a software community---either joining an existing Software Development Kit (SDK) or starting another SDK in an area of interest to you. 
    - The **[Extreme-scale Scientific Software Development Kit (xSDK)](https://xsdk.info)** is a spin-off of the IDEAS project. Members of the xSDK community are working toward a community software ecosystem, including packages developed by diverse, independent teams.  If you develop a numerical software package, consider contributing.  Or have a look at the **[community policies](https://xsdk.info/policies/)** and consider starting another SDK in an area of interest to you.
    - Check out **[SDK-Tools](https://betterscientificsoftware.github.io/SDK-Tools/)**, a collection of documents that support planning for and maintaining the vibrancy of Software Development Kits (SDKs)
    - Learn about the **[Extreme-scale Scientific Software Stack (E4S)](https://e4s.io)**. 


## How to participate throughout the community:

- Get involved with the growing international community of **Research Software Engineers (RSEs)**, including [US-RSE](https://us-rse.org), the [Society of Research Software Engineering](https://society-rse.org), [DE-RSE](https://de-rse.org), and others. These groups are raising awareness of software’s vital role in research and advancing advocacy and resources for those who regularly use expertise in programming to advance research. 

- Check out resources and activities of the UK **[Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk)**---an international leader in advancing software practices.

- Learn from and teach for **[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org)**---organizers of **[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org)**, **[Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org)**, **[Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org)**, and the inspiration for **[HPC Carpentry](http://www.hpc-carpentry.org)**. The Carpentries teach foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide.
 
- Read and contribute to **[Computational Science Stack Exchange](https://scicomp.stackexchange.com)**---a Q&A service that tends to be more towards methods than software per se, but many interested in IDEAS use the site and contribute.

- Explore content at **[BSSw.io](https://bssw.io)**, which includes pointers to many other places to get involved in the community!

### Events

- Contribute to a variety of events focused on scientific software practices take place throughout the community.   For example, the **[Collegeville Workshop Series on Scientific Software](https://collegeville.github.io/Workshops)** and the **[Software Engineering for Computational Science (SE4Science) Workshop Series](http://se4science.org/workshops/)**, and conferences hosted by US-RSE and others.
