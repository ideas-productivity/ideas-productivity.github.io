   upcoming-event: set 'upcoming' true/false based on whether argument
                   is in the future or not
   argument: event = date of event

   Assumptions:
    We assume that the site is operating in the Etc/UTC timezone
    We assume that the events are specified in the EtC/UTC timezone
      (which will be true as long as the site is operating in UTC
      the event itself doesn't include a timezone specification)
    We assume that, in the absence of specific timezones, the best
      way to handle dates is to treat them as being AoE, which
      involves shifting them 12 hours (43200 seconds) from UTC.

  Implementation notes
    The aoedate calculation is a bt convoluted.  It is the current time in the
    UTC-12 timezone (AOE), converted to YYYY-MM-DD format to strip off the time, and then reconverted to a Jekyll date, and then to an integer.
