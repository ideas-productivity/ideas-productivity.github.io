# Research Activities

IDEAS-Watershed is organized around six Research Activities to address important scientific challenges and advance software development methodologies and engagement in the growing community-driven software ecosystem.

# SFA Partnership Activities

The three Partnership Activities, each undertaken jointly with one of SBR’s interdisciplinary Science Focus Areas (SFAs) (LBNL, ORNL, PNNL), addresses biogeochemical cycling in streams across a wide range of stream orders in disparate climates and land-use conditions, from

- **[LBNL]** Watershed Function SFA: East River Use Case – a pristine mountainous headwater catchment
- **[ORNL]** Critical Interfaces SFA: East Fork Poplar Creek Use Case – a fourth-order mercury-contaminated stream in deciduous broadleaf forest in a semitropical humid climate
- **[PNNL]** River Corridor SFA: Columbia River Use Case – to a heavily managed ninth-order river.
The three regional SFAs share a long-term objective of elucidating how surface water/groundwater exchanges across a range of temporal and spatial scales control watershed-scale biogeochemical cycling.

### Here's an example of a level-3 heading
 
But probably we don't need level-3 headings for this description

### And another level-3 heading

To do: Determine what to include for high-level overview info.  This is just a quick skeleton starting point.
