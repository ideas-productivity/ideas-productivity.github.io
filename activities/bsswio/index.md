# Developing scientific software should be a shared experience

Developers of scientific software face many challenges in their work.  While it tends to be easy to find resources about software engineering, it is hard to know which are likely to be applicable to the *scientific* software world.

The [IDEAS-ECP](/activities/ideas-ecp) project launched the [BSSw.io](https://bssw.io/) hub in 2017 as a community-driven site to make resources pertaining to the development of *scientific* software easier to find.

BSSw.io is an informal venue with the goal of making it easy for readers to find and contributors to share useful information and experiences with scientific software development and to publicize events of interest to the community.  An editorial board works with contributors to ensure that our content is and appropriately focused on the engineering of scientific software and of good quality.

## What you'll find on BSSw.io

* Our **[blog](https://bssw.io/blog_posts)** series gives a personal voice to ideas and experiences in the scientific software communty.
* Our **[events](https://bssw.io/events)** stream provides awareness of software-focused events taking place in the community -- webinars, workshops, conferences, or even publicizing surveys about software engineering and related topics.
* The bulk of the site is what we call "**curated content**" -- short articles about useful resources which contributors find useful in their work with scientific software.  They may recommend websites, books, tutorials, publication venues, etc.

BSSw.io also hosts [community landing pages](https://bssw.io/pages/communities-overview) which can orient your community to the resources available on the site.

## Community-driven

The BSSw.io site is driven by the community!  We're [open to contributions](https://bssw.io/pages/what-to-contribute-content-for-better-scientific-software) of the resources you find most useful for scientific software development, events that you're organizing or have heard about, and original articles about your experiences for our blog series. A member of the editorial team will shepherd your contribution through to publication on the site.  Most contributions will take less then thirty minutes of your time.
