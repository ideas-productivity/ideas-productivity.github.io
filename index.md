# Interoperable Design of Extreme-scale Application Software (IDEAS)

IDEAS is a family of projects addressing challenges in software
development productivity and software sustainabilty in computational
science and engineering on high-performance computers.

## Important Note

**The production IDEAS Productivity Project web site is located at
<https://ideas-productivity.org/>.**

This is a working site, to (slowly) convert the official site to
Jekyll.  The content here is intended to mirror (or expand upon) that
on the official site, but they may not be exactly synchronized,
differently formatted, etc.

## Sub-Sites (Work in Progress)

Series](hpc-best-practices-webinars/)
- [Strategies for Working Remotely Panel Series](remote-work-panels/)
