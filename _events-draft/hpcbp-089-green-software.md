    bio: |
      Antigoni Georgiadou is a Computational Scientist in Mathematics at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the Science Engagement Section, Algorithms & Performance Analysis (APA) Group. Dr. Georgiadou obtained her Ph.D. in Computational Mathematics from Florida State University where she worked on optimization in stellar evolution applications. Before joining the APA Group, Antigoni Georgiadou was a postdoctoral research associate in OLCFâ€™s Advanced Computing for Nuclear, Particles, & Astrophysics Group. Astrophysics applications in the areas of astrophysics simulations have been motivating some of her research questions. As a member of the APA Group Dr. Georgiadou collaborates with scientists across domains to optimize performance and requirements of applications on OLCF supercomputers. Dr. Georgiadou is the task lead of the Uncertainty Quantification Working Group in the Science Engagement section and has been supporting INCITE, ECP, and CAAR projects for current and emerging GPU-accelerated systems at the OLCF. Since 2023, Dr. Georgiadou is the Chair of the SC workshop on "Enabling Predictive Science with Optimization and Uncertainty Quantification in HPC" taking place at The International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis (SC'23, SC'24). Since July 2023, she also serves as a member of the Fortran standards committee.

As power consumption of data centers is becoming a hot topic. With the growth of AI and exascale, systems are requiring 30+ MW, enough to power sizable towns. There is a widespread interest in green software development with academia, government, and industry spearheading the discussion on how software developers will produce better software in terms of more energy efficient approaches. I will discuss topics concerning Leadership Computing Facilities with respect to energy consumption, awareness of the costs of running on the system, and the potential green software practices. This talk aims to spark further discussions on specific software practices and topics on energy efficient software. My goals include raising awareness of good software practices, improving scientific productivity, and informing ongoing efforts for sustainability planning.
