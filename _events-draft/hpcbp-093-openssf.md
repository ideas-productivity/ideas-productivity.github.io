      Roscoe A. Bartlett is a researcher and engineer in the Department of Software Engineering and Research at Sandia National Laboratories.  He earned his PhD in chemical engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, where he researched numerical approaches for solving large-scale constrained optimization problems in chemical process engineering.  At Sandia National Laboratories and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, he continued research and development in constrained optimization, sensitivity methods, and the design and integration of large-scale numerical software for computational science & engineering (CSE).  Dr. Bartlett currently focuses on software engineering challenges in CSE, including the quantification and reduction of technical debt, as well as the application of generative AI to automate refactoring and test generation.

  The OpenSSF Best Practices Badge Program represents an impressive collection of the open-source community's knowledge base for creating, maintaining, and sustaining open-source software.   This webinar will provide an overview of this effort and describe some of its surprising benefits. We also describe the experiences, challenges, and benefits from two scientific software projects, MPICH and Ginkgo, which have completed OpenSSF Best Practices passing badges.

The Linux Foundation's OpenSSF Best Practices Badge Program represents an impressive collection of the open-source community's knowledge base for creating, maintaining, and sustaining robust, high-quality, and secure open-source software. At its foundation is a featureful "Badge App" website, which provides a database of projects that document what best practices they have adopted and supporting evidence. This set of best practices (along with the detailed documentation and supporting justifications for each item) also serves as an incremental learning tool and as a foundation for incremental software process and quality improvement efforts. This webinar will provide an overview of this effort and describe some of its surprising benefits. The webinar will also explain how the OpenSSF Best Practices Badge Program can be utilized to continue the recent advances in software quality and sustainability efforts within the computational science and engineering community.  

We also describe the experiences, challenges, and benefits from two HPC software projects, MPICH and Ginkgo, which have completed OpenSSF Best Practices passing badges. 
Developing and maintaining MPICH is a significant software engineering challenge, and MPICH team has developed processes for testing, verification, collaboration and community outreach. We will discuss the lessons learned from developing MPICH and how the OpenSSF best practices map to the MPICH project.
We will also discuss how we achieved the OpenSSF badge for Ginkgo, and the process involved. We will also briefly talk about the benefits of the badge, and its effect on sustainable software development.
