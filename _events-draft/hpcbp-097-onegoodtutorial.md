  I will present recommendations for documenting scientific software based on the concept of a “minimum viable documentation product”: what's the least amount of documentation you need to prepare while still doing right by your users?

Many of us aspire to provide high-quality documentation alongside our scientific software. But rarely do we have much time to write this documentation, and it's easy to get stuck staring at the proverbial “blank page” when sitting down to start writing. I will present some recommendations based on the concept of a “minimum viable documentation product”: what's the *least* amount of documentation you need to prepare while still doing right by your users? These recommendations are gathered in a new resource called [One Good Tutorial](https://onegoodtutorial.org/), whose name captures the top-line advice. You need to provide one good tutorial that shows people how (and why) to use your code. You should provide more than that, but not much more: One Good Tutorial specifies a checklist of nine basic elements that your docs should almost surely include. The resource also includes a “playbook” with a suggested workflow for creating a new checklist-compliant documentation set, and supporting in-depth guides. I will also discuss some of the design and implementation of the resource itself. This work was supported by a 2025 Better Scientific Software Fellowship.
