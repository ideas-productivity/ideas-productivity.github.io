  Visually communicating elements of research software design can enable improved communication and extension of the software architecture and included models. This webinar describes the Unified Modeling Language as a mechanism for software diagramming as well as concrete methods for incorporating this practice into research software development workflows.
---
Research software projects have unique constraints from funding agencies and incentives for the researchers who produce the software. To address these challenges and improve understanding of software architecture for research projects, this webinar presents methods for visually communicating elements of software design and incorporating them into typical software development workflows. The webinar introduces the Unified Modeling Language (UML) through the book *UML Distilled*, while also describing and demonstrating tools and methods for UML automation. The webinar also discusses how this approach of focusing on software architecture can bring attention to the important and impactful craft of research software engineering.
