  Visually communicating elements of research software design can enable improved communication and extension of the software architecture and included models. This webinar describes the Unified Modeling Language as a mechanism for software diagramming as well as concrete methods for incorporating this practice into research software development workflows.
---
Research software projects have unique constraints from funding agencies and incentives for the researchers who produce the software. To mitigate these impacts and improve understanding of the software architecture, this webinar presents methods for visually communicating elements of software design and incorporating them into typical software development workflows. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is introduced through the book *UML Distilled*. Tools and methods for automation are described and demonstrated. Finally, the possibility of this method to bring attention to the craft of research software engineering is proposed.
