# README for the `_events-draft` folder

This folder is intended for the development of events prior to their publication. Events here will be accessible via the *internal* section of the website. Remember, however that links to the *internal* section of the website should not be used in public settings.

The usual practice would be to prepare the event here, share the internal URL with presenters, reviewers, etc., as needed. After the content is settled, it can be published by `git mv`ing it to `_events` (or the appropriate subdirectory).
