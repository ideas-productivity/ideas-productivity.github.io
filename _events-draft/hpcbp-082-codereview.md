[code-review.org](https://code-review.org) is an online tutorial for code review made possible by the Better Scientific Software Fellowship Program*. Code review is a skill. You can break it down, you can practice, and you can get better at it. The difficult thing is you are often learning a bunch of other skills at the same time. Scientists are often working on a new scientific problem while trying to learn git, GitHub, a programming language... all while someone ‘criticizes’ their code. Equally, scientific software developers may start work in a domain they know little about. It can be very difficult to separate criticism of the code from criticism of the person. Reviewing is hard - You really have to take into account how to communicate constructive and actionable criticism. [code-review.org](https://code-review.org) aims to provide a way to practice reviewing in a no consequence environment using the tutorial. Experience with code review from the NCAR Software Engineering Assembly will be presented, including positive and negative effects of code review.
