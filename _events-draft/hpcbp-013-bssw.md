  - name: Mike Heroux
    affiliation: Sandia National Laboratories
    github-id: maherou
    bio: "Mike Heroux is a senior scientist at the Center
for Computing Research, Sandia National Laboratories, in Albuquerque,
New Mexico. At Sandia, he works on new parallel algorithm developments
for problems of interest to Sandia and the broader scientific and
engineering community. Michael leads the development of Trilinos,
which provides state of the art solution methods in a state of the art
software framework, the Mantevo project, which focuses on the
development of Open Source, portable mini-applications and
mini-drivers for scientific and engineering applications. He strongly
advocates practices that improve software productivity and
sustainability."

Better Scientific Software (BSSw) is an organization dedicated to
improving developer productivity and software sustainability for
computational science and engineering (CSE).  This presentation will
introduce a new website (<https://bssw.io>)—a community exchange for
scientific software improvement.  We’re creating a clearinghouse to
gather, discuss, and disseminate experiences, techniques, tools, and
other resources to improve software productivity and sustainability
for CSE. Site users can find information on scientific software topics
and can propose to curate or create new content based on their own
experiences. The backend enables collaborative content development
using standard GitHub tools and processes.  We need your contributions
to build the BSSw site into a vibrant resource, with content and
editorial processes provided by volunteers throughout the
international CSE community.  Join us!
