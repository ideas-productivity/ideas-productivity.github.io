<!-- Extended Description -->

The IDEAS team collaborates widely to organize software-related sessions at larger meetings as well as standalone events.  These events are intended to create opportunities to talk about software development, productivity, sustainability, and related topics.  These may take the form of technical sessions or informal "birds-of-a-feather" (BoF) sessions within larger conferences, or standalone workshops.

## Who should attend

Our technical sessions are organized around topics chosen to suit the hosting venue and are likely to be of interest to anyone who is anyone who is involved in or cares about the development and use of scientific software.

## Registration

Most events require advance registration with the hosting venue and may require fee.

## Organize something with us!
