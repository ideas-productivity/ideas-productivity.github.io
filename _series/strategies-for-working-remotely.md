<!-- Extended Description -->

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for many in our community to transition to unplanned remote work, the IDEAS Productivity project has launched the panel series Strategies for Working Remotely, which explores important topics in this area. The series brings together staff members of DOE laboratories and invited guests to speak about experiences in working remotely and transitioning from co-located and partially distributed teams to fully virtual teams, and teams of teams. Topics include challenges, lessons learned, unforeseen benefits, and opportunities to look for from this experience. Panelists will make brief introductory comments followed by open discussion.

The sessions are independent, so join any and all.  

## Format

The panelists make short statements or presentations related to the panel topic, and then the moderator opens the floor to discussion and questions from the audience. Due to the number of participants, we use chat capability to pose questions that are conveyed to the panelists by the moderator. Questions are curated for uniqueness. Recordings of the panels along with presentation slides and resources are posted here and on the ECP website.

## Registration

Participation is free and open to the public. Registration is required for each event. Those who register will also receive notification when the webinar recording is available.
